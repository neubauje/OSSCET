Grantmaking at JPMorgan Chase
JPMorgan Chase makes programmatic grants aligned with the firm’s impact pillars: Careers & Skills, Business Growth & Entrepreneurship, Financial Health & Wealth Creation, and Community Development, all aimed at expanding inclusive and equitable economic opportunity. By focusing on these challenges, we hope to have a greater collective impact on the communities we serve.



Unsolicited Requests
Our grant application is by invitation only and, due to the volume of requests we receive each year, we are unable to review unsolicited letters of inquiry or proposals. Our funding decisions are based solely on alignment with our strategic priorities and an organization’s demonstrated success in one of these focus areas. Business relationships do not inform our grantmaking.



CRA Requests
At times, nonprofit organizations and other stakeholders approach the firm wanting to learn more about CRA grants, and bankers will inquire how external stakeholders can access CRA grants. At JPMorgan Chase, we do not have a dedicated source of funding for CRA. Due to the nature of our grantmaking and its focus on the firm’s impact pillars and on economic inclusion, most of our partners and grant dollars inherently align with and help drive the firm’s efforts to serve low- to moderate-income communities. Therefore, all of CR’s programmatic grants are reviewed for CRA eligibility once deployed. 



Line of Business Contributions
If your LOB is looking for information on how to make a charitable contribution, please visit the Express Contributions site, which is the U.S. Charitable Contribution Process. All LOB Contribution requests must be submitted via this process. For the APAC, EMEA, LATAM, and Canada Charitable Contribution Process please visit this page.



Market Leadership Team (MLT) Contributions 
The firm also deploys sponsorships and contributions through MLTs. MLTs consider requests for support that benefit multiple lines of business and activate the JPMorgan Chase brand in the community. Reach out to your LOB's representative on your MLT or the support lead to learn more. 



Nominating an organization for the firm's Workplace Giving program
Employees wishing to support a U.S. nonprofit may be able to take advantage of JPMorgan Chase’s Workplace Giving program, which enables eligible employees to deepen the impact of their personal contributions to valid 501(c)(3) nonprofits of their choice with a dollar-for-dollar match up to $1,000 annually. If you already have a nonprofit in mind, you can search to see if it is eligible for matching at go/giving (click on Workplace Giving and how you would like to donate. The easiest way to search for a nonprofit is by its EIN/Tax ID). If the organization you prefer is not eligible at this time, you can nominate them before making a contribution. 

The firm also participates in Giving Tuesday during which the firm will double contributions for eligible employees* up to $2,000 (this is in addition to the traditional Workplace Giving limit).

In addition, if you serve on the governing board of a valid 501(c)(3) public charity, you may be eligible for a dollar-for-dollar match up to a higher level using the Board Match Program instead.

Express Contributions is the U.S. Charitable Contribution Process. All LOB Contribution requests must be submitted through the orange “Express Contributions Donation Request” button.
Once a donation request is submitted it will be reviewed by the Global Supplier Services Team. When the review is complete further instructions will be sent to you by the GSS review team via email.  Most donation requests will be automatically routed for approval through Ariba with no further action needed by the submitter.  If the email you receive provides direction that CONCUR is the correct method for your payment request, please follow the CONCUR Invoice User Guide to submit your donation request.  No action should be taken however until given instruction by the GSS team.

IF YOU NEED TO SUBMIT A NON-CHARITABLE PAYMENT REQUEST, PLEASE VISIT THE EXPRESS PAY HOMEPAGE

Notifying Nonprofits Post Payment Completion
Once Corporate Accounts Payable has issued the payment for the charitable contribution, the Contributor must generate a U.S. Charitable Contribution Cover Letter and send it to the nonprofit organization.

At the end of the month following the payment date, a secure link to the online substantiation form will be sent from cgadmin@cybergrants.com to the nonprofit organization contact email address listed on the U.S. Charitable Contribution Form and should be completed within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the link.
Any questions the nonprofit may have can be directed to JPMC.Contributions@jpmchase.com.

The Market Leadership Team (MLT) program is dedicated to delivering the firm locally to our clients, being leaders in our communities and creating a rewarding experience for our employees. Our MLTs also deliver one cohesive and united team to local markets and help enrich the communities where we live and work.

Workplace Giving Overview
JPMorgan Chase supports our employees’ philanthropic giving by deepening the impact of each gift. Over the past three years, more than 41,000 JPMorgan Chase employees generously contributed over $45 million to nonprofit organizations globally. JPMorgan Chase deepened the impact of those donations, contributing an additional $51 million. With your financial generosity, the firm can continue to create lasting impact for our communities, customers and employees.
The Workplace Giving program is simple. JPMorgan Chase will match your charitable contributions automatically to a nonprofit organization of your choice up to $1,000 in a calendar year for eligible employees.*

Select any eligible 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization*. If your nonprofit is not available, nominate it. In order to participate in the Workplace Giving program, eligible 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations are required to accept our updated terms and conditions and provide electronic banking information. These new requirements will reduce risk and facilitate getting the funds to your nonprofit.
Donate to your nonprofit by enrolling in recurring payroll deduction, one-time credit card donation, or log your offline donations.
For eligible employees,* once you submit the gift, a match will be automatically generated to your nonprofit in the order of submission until the annual match of $1,000 is reached.
Review the Workplace Giving FAQs to learn more.

If you serve on the governing board of a valid 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, you may be eligible for a dollar-for-dollar match up to a higher level using the Board Match Program instead.

*Employees earning more than $250,000 in base pay are not eligible to receive a dollar-for-dollar match. This base pay threshold is in line with other employee benefits at the firm.
